        How a datacube and 4d visualisations turn Dutch spatial data into patterns,
        time travel, and foresight.
      </p>
    </header>

    <section>
      <p>
        You might remember in my previous blog,
        <em>From Chaos to Clarity</em>, when we turned messy datasets into a
        single, structured foundation — a spatial datacube that finally made
        sense of all those CSVs, shapefiles, and spreadsheets.
      </p>

      <p>
        Now that the data is clean and connected, the next question is:
        <strong>What can we actually see when everything speaks the same
        spatial language?</strong>
      </p>

      <p>That’s where H3 comes in.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>The honeycomb that makes data talk</h2>

      <p>
        H3 divides the world into a honeycomb of hexagons, each one
        representing an equal slice of the Earth’s surface. Whether you’re
        looking at housing prices, noise levels, flood risk, or biodiversity,
        each dataset aligns perfectly on the same grid.
      </p>

      <p>
        It turns chaotic maps into something more like building blocks. Once
        everything fits, we can start constructing meaning, not just
        visualizations.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 1 – One map, one story</h2>

      <p>Let’s start simple.</p>

      <p>
        Take one indicator from the datacube — <strong>groundheight</strong>,
        the height above sea level. Visualized through H3, each hexagon tells
        you how high (or low) the land sits relative to NAP.
      </p>

      <p>
        A map like this immediately shows why the Dutch saying
        <em>“God created the world, but the Dutch created the Netherlands”</em>
        is more than a cliché. Much of the country lies below sea level, yet we
        live, build, and cycle there safely thanks to centuries of design and
        engineering.
      </p>

      <p>
        An interactive map of groundheight, or a short video zooming across the
        hexagons, turns an abstract number into something intuitive:
      </p>

      <div class="iframe-wrapper full-width">
        <iframe
          src="https://maps.mapsthatmatter.io/groundheight"
          height="800"
          loading="lazy"
          title="Groundheight map"
        ></iframe>
      </div>

      <p>
        This is the first step in developing spatial literacy: making data feel
        real.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 2 – When one layer isn’t enough: travelling through time</h2>

      <p>
        To understand how areas change, a single snapshot is rarely enough.
        This is where H3 becomes especially powerful: because every hexagon is
        tracked over multiple years, we can explore spatial change as a kind of
        time travel.
      </p>

      <h3>A small detour: what happens when you compare landcover with people?</h3>

      <p>
        While exploring the datacube, I ran a quick correlation check between
        landcover (LGN) and demographic indicators (CBS). As expected, the
        positive correlations brought no surprises. Places with more built-up
        area tend to have:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>more inhabitants (r ≈ 0.79)</li>
        <li>more men and women (r ≈ 0.79)</li>
        <li>more households (r ≈ 0.78)</li>
        <li>more housing (r ≈ 0.78)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In other words: where you build more, more people live. Nothing
        shocking.
      </p>

      <p>
        The negative correlations, however, revealed something more unexpected —
        and unintentionally funny.
      </p>

      <p>
        The strongest negative relationships appear between
        <strong>agrarisch grasland</strong> (agricultural grassland) and almost
        every demographic variable. For example:
      </p>

      <ul>
        <li>fewer women (r ≈ –0.43)</li>
        <li>fewer total inhabitants (r ≈ –0.43)</li>
        <li>fewer men (r ≈ –0.42)</li>
        <li>fewer households (r ≈ –0.40)</li>
      </ul>

      <p>
        In plain language: the more agricultural grass a hexagon contains, the
        fewer women (and people in general) live there.
      </p>

      <p>
        A perfectly logical spatial pattern… but also the exact data-driven
        explanation for the existence of the TV show
        <em>“Boer zoekt Vrouw”</em> (“Farmer seeks a wife”).
      </p>

      <p>
        According to the hexagons, farmers quite literally live in places where
        there are statistically fewer women — a demographic phenomenon neatly
        confirmed by Pearson’s r.
      </p>

      <p>Spatial analysis, it turns out, sometimes comes with its own punchline.</p>

      <h3>Time travel on the Maasvlakte</h3>

      <p>
        The second interactive example shows temporal change beautifully. Built-up
        area is visualised in 3D height, while the colour shows the number of
        inhabitants. By moving the year slider, you can watch neighbourhoods
        grow, densify, or shift in character over time.
      </p>

      <p>
        A striking example appears on the <strong>Maasvlakte in Rotterdam</strong>.
        Slide the timeline to <strong>2022</strong> and you will see tall blocks
        of built-up area — yet the hexagons remain dark in colour, indicating
        zero inhabitants. At first glance this looks like a data error, but it
        is not. What you are seeing is the moment when newly created land was
        developed for industrial use, not residential living. The map makes the
        transformation visible: a landscape that didn’t exist a decade ago
        becomes a major industrial extension of the port, without adding new
        population.
      </p>

      <p>
        This is the strength of hexagon-based time travel: the map shows not
        just where things are, but how and when they appeared.
      </p>

      <p>
        This interactive map makes this intuitive even for non-technical audiences. Changing
        the year slider tells a story in seconds — urban expansion, industrial
        growth, and changing spatial footprints become visible without reading
        a single table.
      </p>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 3 – Talking to your data</h2>

      <p>
        Once the metadata is structured and described in JSON, something
        interesting becomes possible: the data becomes conversational.
      </p>

      <p>
        Imagine looking for a house in the province of the South-Holland, and the criteria you have are: 
        1. Above sea-level by 0.3 m, I dont mind getting my feet wet, but anything above that is quite uncomfortable.
        2. I dont want to build a new house, I want to know where there already are some houses.
        3. I like my piece and quiet, meaning I want to live in an area below a certain level of background noise.
        4. I don't want to live close to an area close to a toxic gas cloud attention area, so not in the vicinity of industrial area's. 
        
        This criteria can than be explored by simply typing:

        <em>Where is the terrain higher than 30 centimeters above sea level (NAP), so the risk of flooding is smaller?
        Where is there already an existing residential function, so where people are already allowed or able to live?
        Where is it relatively quiet, with a noise level below 50 decibels (Lden)?
        Where is it outside a toxic cloud attention area, meaning there is no increased risk in case of a chemical incident?</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        An LLM interprets these sentences, looks up what each field means, and
        translates it into a query on the H3 datacube. No SQL required. Just a
        conversation with your map, as shown in the video below.
      </p>
      <div class="video-wrapper full-width">
        <video 
            src="videos/llm_example_housing.mp4"
            controls 
            autoplay 
            muted 
            loop
        ></video>
      </div>
      <p>
        This video of our tool at the Province of South-Holland shows a chat prompt on one side and a
        map on the other which makes this interaction feel tangible. This works
        because the data is described clearly enough for humans and machines to
        understand it in the same way.
      </p>

      <p>
        Imagine taking it one step further. Since we have the data of several years in the datacube, 
        we can even ask it temporal changes. So, suddenly a complex temporal change analysis becomes
        a simple question in human language. For example, ask 
        <em>“Where have the number of inhabitants decreased and where has the forest area increased 
        between 2018 and 2023?”</em> and the visualization shows you these area's. This is showing a 
        trend analysis in a simple way. This might be a criteria as well when looking for a new house, 
        as you might want to focus on an areas where the population is decreasing, but the forest area 
        is increasing, as this might indicate a more quiet and green environment.
      </p>
      <div class="image-wrapper">
        <img 
        src="images/inhabitants_vs_forest_2018_2023.png" 
        alt="Inhabitants vs Forest correlation between 2018–2023" 
        style="width: 100%; height: auto; border-radius: 8px; border: 1px solid #ddd;"
        />
      </div>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 4 – From patterns to predictions</h2>

      <p>
        The dataset spans 2018 to 2023, which means each hexagon contains a
        small timeline. Plotting these values — for example, average WOZ value
        or number of new homes — reveals how regions have evolved. Some areas
        densify, others stabilize, some shift slowly without anyone noticing.
      </p>

      <p>
        Even simple trend analysis allows us to project where growth, pressure,
        or risk may increase if these patterns continue. These are not perfect
        forecasts, but they provide foresight.
      </p>

      <p>
        An animated interactive timelapse showing the rise in WOZ values or
        changes in population density makes these trajectories visible. Once you
        see how areas evolve, the conversation moves from “what happened?” to
        “what should we prepare for?”
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 5 – Play, explore, decide</h2>

      <p>
        You do not need specialist software to explore these patterns. An
        interactive dashboard works directly in the browser.
      </p>

      <p>
        In workshops, even non-technical teams immediately begin asking sharper
        questions. Someone invariably points at the map and says:
        <em>“So that’s why those two areas feel so different.”</em>
      </p>

      <p>
        This is exactly the point: spatial data should be intuitive. A simple
        interactive map with sliders for year, WOZ value, or noise level
        invites managers and policymakers to explore and experiment.
      </p>

      <p>
        Including an embedded interactive dashboard in this blog gives readers the
        chance to hover over their neighbourhood and discover which hexagons
        surprise them.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Step 6 – Looking ahead</h2>

      <p>
        This is only the beginning. In the next blog, I will explore how the
        same H3 grid can connect to real-time data streams such as satellite
        imagery, weather sensors, or biodiversity indicators.
      </p>

      <p>
        When datasets share the same spatial language, collaboration becomes far
        easier. Maps stop being static reports and start functioning as shared
        interfaces for conversation and decision-making.
      </p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2>Final thought: the power of pattern recognition</h2>

      <p>
        Each hexagon is a data point, but together they form a story about how
        we live, build, and adapt.
      </p>

      <p>
        The strength of H3 lies not only in precision but in perspective. It
        allows managers, designers, citizens, and data specialists to see the
        landscape through the same lens — whether they are searching for
        opportunity, quality of life, or long-term resilience.
      </p>

      <p>
        From data to dialogue. From hexagons to foresight. From maps that
        describe the world to maps that help us shape it.
      </p>
